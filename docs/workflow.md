## Build Steps

The build process is divided into several steps, each with a specific purpose. The steps are defined in the Makefiles and are executed in a specific order to ensure that the project is built, tested, and published correctly.

- **lint**: This step checks the code for style and formatting errors.
- **build**: This step compiles the code and creates the artifacts.
- **test**: This step runs the tests to ensure that the code is working correctly.
- **publish**: This step publishes the artifacts to a package repository.
- **promote**: This step promotes the artifacts to a production environment.
