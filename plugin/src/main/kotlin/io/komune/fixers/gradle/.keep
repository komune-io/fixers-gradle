Classes are copied from build-composite module to config module during build.
This ensures a single source of truth while making classes available for compilation.

The copy is implemented in the root build.gradle.kts file as a Gradle task named "copyConfigSources".
It runs automatically before compilation because the config module's "compileKotlin" task depends on it.

When running "./gradlew clean build":
1. The "clean" task triggers "cleanConfigSources" to remove any previously copied files
2. The "build" task includes compilation, which triggers "copyConfigSources" to copy fresh files
